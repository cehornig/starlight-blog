title: "Opinion: On Taking Breaks"
---
I disappeared! And now I'm back! Why did I disappear? Well...I wanted a break. Specifically, I wanted to spend more time on my fiction. I'd been trying to post once every month, which eats a surprising amount of time when you're <a href="/why-nanowrimo-doesnt-work-for-me" target="_blank">a slow writer like me</a>. Also when you tend to write about books, which, you know, take a while to read. I couldn't invest that much effort in the blog while investing enough in my stories to satisfy my unusually active author brain, so I put it on the back burner until I'd gotten some of the fiction out of my system. 

I'm aware that this wasn't the most productive thing for a new blogger to do. Readers and search engines prefer sites with regular posts, so if you want to be seen, you should stick to a consistent schedule. And yet I'd bet a boatload of cash that I'll take more breaks in the future. In fact, I think writing _without_ a consistent schedule is the best way to run this blog.

I'm doing this for fun. I love fiction, and I love discussing fiction, and I started _Writing by Starlight_ to give a home to all those thoughts and words. But my priorities fluctuate, and I like having the freedom to focus on other hobbies when they capture my interest. If I demand regular blog posts, I'll inevitably end up forcing myself to post when I'd rather be doing something else. If I'd rather be doing something else, I won't enjoy it. If I don't enjoy it, the blog's purpose is soundly defeated.

Will greater flexibility result in a smaller audience? Probably. But I'd rather have a smaller audience than turn a passion project into a tiresome obligation. Besides, life gives us enough tiresome obligations. Why toss another onto the stack?

So if I feel like taking more breaks, darn it, I'll take more breaks. Hopefully anyone who's found this blog will stick with it all the same.

(On another note, I may write more opinion pieces like this. I enjoy non-fiction-related rambling as much as I enjoy fiction-related rambling, and I'd love to put some of those rambles here. I know it's not the blog's stated priority, but it's fun for me, and hopefully for any readers drifting around on the interwebs. And that's what really matters, right?)

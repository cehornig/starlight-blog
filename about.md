Welcome! I'm Taylor. By day, I work on websites. By night, I write speculative fiction, read speculative fiction, or play video games that are, uh, speculative fiction. So I thought, why not start a blog about speculative fiction? Thus _Writing by Starlight_ was born. I expect primarily to write reviews here, but I may post original fiction, or do something else of the speculative variety. Stay tuned.

I'm also the creator of [Sunline](https://sunline-app.herokuapp.com), a web application that plots the sun's path on a given location at a given date, and the author of [The Doctor's Mask](https://magazine.metaphorosis.com/story/2016/the-doctors-mask-taylor-hornig/), a short science fiction story I
published way back when. Check them out if you like astronomical charts and
genetically modified humans with unpleasant pasts, respectively.

Welcome! I'm Taylor. By day, I work on websites. By night, I write fiction, read fiction, and, uh, talk about fiction. So I thought, why not start a blog about fiction? Thus _Writing by Starlight_ was born. I expect mostly to write about speculative fiction, which is my preferred genre, but I may discuss other flavors, or post my own work, or do something shockingly exciting that I won't think of for a year. Only time will tell.

I'm also the creator of <a href="https://sunline-app.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Sunline</a>, a web application that plots the sun's path on a given location at a given date, and the author of <a href="https://magazine.metaphorosis.com/story/2016/the-doctors-mask-taylor-hornig/" target="_blank">The Doctor's Mask</a>, a short science fiction story I
published way back when. Check them out if you like astronomical charts and genetically modified humans with unpleasant pasts, respectively.

If you feel so inclined, you can bug me on <a href="http://twitter.com/theastrocrow" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, or toss me an email at <a href="mailto:typesbystarlight@gmail.com">typesbystarlight@gmail.com</a>. (Warning: I rarely use Twitter, and have the social media skills of a rock).

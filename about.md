Welcome! I'm Taylor. By day, I work on websites. By night, I write fiction, read fiction, and, uh, talk about fiction. So I thought, why not start a blog about fiction? Thus _Writing by Starlight_ was born. I expect mostly to write about speculative fiction, which is my preferred genre, but I may discuss other flavors, or post my own work, or do something shockingly exciting that I won't think of for a year. Only time will tell.

I'm also the creator of [Sunline](https://sunline-app.herokuapp.com), a web application that plots the sun's path on a given location at a given date, and the author of [The Doctor's Mask](https://magazine.metaphorosis.com/story/2016/the-doctors-mask-taylor-hornig/), a short science fiction story I
published way back when. Check them out if you like astronomical charts and
genetically modified humans with unpleasant pasts, respectively.
